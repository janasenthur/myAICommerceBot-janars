# 🎨 How to Add Your Logo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Prepare your logo file:**
   - Format: PNG, JPG, or GIF
   - Recommended size: 300x150 pixels (landscape orientation works best)
   - Name it `logo.png`

2. **Save it in the right location:**
   ```
   myAICommerceBot-janars/
   └── assets/
       └── logo.png  ← Put your logo here
   ```

3. **Run the chatbot:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```

4. **Your logo will appear:**
   - 🎯 **In the sidebar** above the Quick Actions menu
   - 🏷️ **In the title** replacing the cart emoji (as a small icon)
   - 🌙 **Dark theme** optimized for professional appearance

## Logo Placement:

✅ **Sidebar Logo**: Large version (150px width) at the top of the sidebar  
✅ **Title Logo**: Small version (50px width) next to the main title  
✅ **Dark Background**: Optimized for dark theme with proper contrast

## That's it! 🎉

The chatbot will automatically detect and display your logo in both locations. The interface uses a professional dark theme that makes your branding stand out.
