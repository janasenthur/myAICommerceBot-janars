### Changing the AI Model

You can easily switch between different models by modifying the `llm` initialization in `chatbot.py`:

```python

llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", openai_api_key="your_openai_key")

# For Google Gemini
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro", google_api_key="your_google_key")

# Current: Meta Llama via Together AI
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo",
    openai_api_key=TOGETHER_API_KEY,
    openai_api_base="https://api.together.xyz/v1"
)
```

### Adjusting Memory Settings

Modify the conversation memory window size for better shopping context retention:

```python
st.session_state.buffer_memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=5, return_messages=True)
```

### Customizing Commerce Categories

You can customize the shopping categories and quick actions by modifying the sidebar section in `chatbot.py`:

```python
# Add custom quick action buttons
if st.button("üéÆ Gaming Products"):
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Show me the latest gaming products and deals."})
    st.rerun()
