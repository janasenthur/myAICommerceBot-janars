# Assets Folder

This folder contains static assets for the AI Commerce Chatbot.

## Logo Instructions

To add your company logo:

1. **Save your logo file** as `logo.png` in this folder
2. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: PNG (supports transparency)
   - Dimensions: 300x150 pixels (landscape ratio preferred)
   - File size: Under 2MB for fast loading
   - Background: Transparent or works well on dark backgrounds

3. **Supported formats:**
   - PNG (recommended)
   - JPG/JPEG
   - GIF
   - BMP

4. **Alternative names supported:**
   - `logo.png` (preferred)
   - `logo.jpg`
   - `logo.jpeg`
   - `logo.gif`

## Logo Placement

Your logo will appear in **two locations**:

### üéØ Sidebar Logo (Primary)
- **Location**: Top of the left sidebar, above Quick Actions
- **Size**: 150px width, responsive height
- **Purpose**: Main branding presence

### üè∑Ô∏è Title Logo (Secondary)  
- **Location**: Next to "AI Commerce Assistant" title
- **Size**: 50px width as small icon
- **Purpose**: Replaces the cart emoji in the main title

## Dark Theme Optimization

The chatbot uses a professional dark theme:
- **Background**: Dark gray (#0e1117)
- **Sidebar**: Darker gray (#262730)
- **Accent**: Green (#00c851)

Ensure your logo has good contrast against dark backgrounds.

## How It Works

- If `logo.png` exists, it will be displayed in both locations
- The logo is automatically sized and positioned
- If no logo file is found, default icons will be shown instead
- Dark theme styling ensures professional appearance

## Example Usage

Simply place your logo file here:
```
assets/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.png
```

The chatbot will automatically detect and display it in both locations!
